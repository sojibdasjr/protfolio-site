            <p>
                My name is SOJiB DAS I’m a dreamer, I’m a believer and I’m a doer. I am well known for my presentation
                skill. I can speak very well both in Bengali and English. Another quality of me that I feel proud of is
                –
                I’m a quick learner and self-motivated person. I have learned to using computer by myself without
                anyone’s
                help. It’s a tough job for most people.I was born and brought up in Dewkhola,Fulbaria, Mymensingh,
                Bangladesh. I’ve spend my childhood in the midst of greenery, in a remote village. . My father worked as
                a
                tailor, there were 5 of us in the family. I am second among them. I have an older sister and a younger
                sister. I lost my father on May 10, 2020. It was a very big heartache for me .I am frank and pretty
                friendly. Some say I’m introvert but when it comes to public speaking, I sure talk! I have my only
                weakness
                which is, I can’t say No to people. I find it difficult to refuse people specially when it’s about
                helping
                them.

            <p>
                When I become a web developer, those who have insulted me all the time say that nothing will happen to
                me. I
                can't do any work. Then I will tell them, people never have to make fun of the present. Because maybe
                one
                day he will be a much bigger one in his endeavors.I want to be a web developer I want to do a lot for my
                country and I want to do something for the kids in my area I will try to teach a lot for free by doing
                web development
